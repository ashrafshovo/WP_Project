You''re probably also concerned about your Google security, but not so concerned that you do anything about it. Well, Google wants to make you a sweet deal to encourage to check your security settings. Google will give you an additional 2GBs of free Google Drive storage just for checking your Google security settings.\r\n\r\nGoogle Security Check\r\nsjvn\r\nThat''s it. There''s no catch. Just spend about two minutes double-checking your Google security settings, which you should have been doing anyway, and you get free storage. What''s not to like?\r\n\r\nFirst, you''ll log into your Google account. Next, you''re asked to check on your Recovery information. If you haven''t added a phone number to your Google account, it will ask you to add one.\r\n\r\nThis is not the same thing as adding Google two-step verification to your account. You should add two-factor authentication to your account for better security, but Google isn''t asking you do that this time. Google just wants to make sure that if you''re locked out of your account, you can use your phone number to recover access to your account if you''ve been hacked.\r\n\r\nThis section of the security checkup will also ask you for a secondary e-mail account and a security hint. If you already have all the above in place, Google simply asks that you recheck that they''re still current and correct.\r\n\r\nNext, the security checkup asks you if you recognize all the devices you''ve been using with your Google account. I found no surprises. But, if you spot a device you don''t recognize or one of your gadgets appears to be being used somewhere you''ve never been, Google provides instructions on how to double check your account''s security.\r\n\r\nADVERTISING\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter that, Google will ask you if you want to disable access to less secure apps. Google has been pushing to make the net more secure in general. Recently, Google announcd that its Chrome web browser will start marking all HTTP sites which don''t use HTTPS encryption as unsafe.\r\n\r\nNow, Google is giving you the option of blocking accesss to apps that do not support the security standards. These include:\r\n\r\nThe Mail app on your iphone or ipad with iOS 6 or below\r\nThe Mail app on your Windows phone preceding the 8. 1 release\r\nSome Desktop mail clients like Microsoft Outlook and Mozilla Thunderbird\r\nIf you''re still using such apps with Google services, you can elect to keep using them. You''d be foolish for doing so, but that''s your call.\r\n\r\nFinally, Google asks you to review the apps, websites, and devices connected to your Google Account. If you don''t recognize one or more of them, or no longer use them you can remove their access to your Google account. Typically, these are online services, such as Nextdoor. com, Pinterest, or Sandvine in my case, where you use your Google account as your service ID.\r\n\r\nThat''s all there is to it. Once you''re done, you get 2GBs of free Google storage permanently. The only catch is you only must complete your checkup by February 18. I think for an investment of about five-minutes for 2GBs of free storage, it''s worth finding the time.', 'Internet', 0x75706c6f61642f676f6f676c652e706e67, '2016-12-15 00:00:00', 0, 0),
(3, 'Team TechForum', '7 Reasons Why Ecommerce Websites Are Underperforming in 2016', 'The whole world has accepted the digital media for business. Everyone knows the limitations of physical market over the online market. Physical market businesspersons were eager and always optimize their shops with various trendy material. Same concept can be applied to the digital market, where website optimization services helps to improve your online presence. An eCommerce website has always faced many competitions. This is one among the reasons behind why businesses flunk online.\r\n\r\nThe market researchers have worked for estimating the reasons for successful online business. Using the Google, researchers have verified and have concluded the following 7 reasons why an eCommerce website do not perform as expected:\r\n\r\n1: Not Optimized Ecommerce Website\r\nWebsite bulkiness makes it unoptimized. Several website optimization analysis has proven that any website that do not have any optimized codes will lose a lot of traffic of the website. Mainly, these visitors moved to the competitor’s website because the competitor has optimized website code to make it less weighty or slim.\r\n\r\nGoogle PageSpeed Insights call often use the word “Minification”, which means lessening your website size. Most of the time the website becomes bulky wing to the use of codes that might be useful or sometimes not. It is always better to trim down the code and maintain a balance between content and code. The website build should always remain optimized. Mobile speed optimized website are always welcomed in this digital world.\r\n\r\n#2: Poor Product Image Quality\r\nThis reason stands among the worst of its own kind. When any user lands on your website, he or she wants to see what your website products contain. Images are the best option to portray your product features. Now if you show a very filthy image with pixels burst out, visitors abandon your website and move somewhere else.\r\nMaintain an extremely high quality image while using it as your product showcase. More the user understands the beauty of your product from image; more will be the sale count. So, quality does matters a lot. Give quality to your audience and in return you will achieve what you deserve, that is profit and good business growth.\r\n\r\n#3: Large Size Images\r\nKeeping quality images ensures a rise in sales. Most of the times, such images contribute to the increase in loading time of your website. Say for example, if your image size resides in Megabytes segment, it may happen that the user will see images in parts. It means that the images appear slowly on your website and the loading symbol keeps rotating in your Title Bar.\r\n\r\nThis is the most hateful experience for a new visitor. The above 2 conditions are collectively known as “Unoptimized Images”. If your website has such problem, kindly refer to a Website optimization service provider and optimize your images. Even if you build your website with WordPress, then you have several alternatives to chop off your image size without disturbing the quality. Most of the time I have seen that the plugins offering Image Optimization reduces image size by 20% only. This does not have any impact on the website loading. The best image chopper till date can be found with PageSpeedOptimizer, which reduce your image size by 70% – 90% without harming your image quality (uses a lossless compression technique based on artificial intelligence).\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\n\r\neCommerce business moving online, have created a great competition world-wide. Now everyone searches for a better option of increasing the business through his or her websites. That’s the primary reason why a person must optimize the website, which will help in getting global recognition. People very well know how to achieve a great ranking on search engine, but they fall back on the search count. The primary reason includes not optimizing website.\r\n\r\nWhen an eCommerce website lacks optimization of code and images, increased loading page speed, and create a bad impression in customer’s mind, the business gets affected. Any eCommerce website must take care of the parameters that can affect the customer’s psychology and eventually reduces the visits and revisits from a valuable customer. Above-mentioned points will certainly help to increase the sell from any eCommerce website.\r\n', 'Internet', 0x75706c6f61642f372d726561736f6e732d5768792d45636f6d6d657263652d576562736974652d6e6f742d706572666f726d696e672d61732d65787065637465642d333438783138302e6a7067, '2016-12-16 20:10:12', 0, 0),
(4, 'Team TechForum', 'Facebook now flags and down-ranks fake news with help from outside fact checkers', 'Snopes, FactCheck.org, Politifact, ABC News, and AP will help Facebook make good on four of the six promises Mark Zuckerberg made about fighting fake news without it becoming “the arbiter of truth.” It will make fake news posts less visible, append warnings from fact checkers to fake news in the feed, make reporting hoaxes easier and disrupt the financial incentives of fake news spammers.\r\n\r\n“We’re not looking to get into the grey area of opinion,” Facebook’s VP of News Feed Adam Mosseri tells me. “What we are focusing on with this work is specifically the worst of the work — clear hoaxes that were shared intentionally, usually by spammers, for financial gain.”\r\n\r\nFacebook will now refer to fact-checking services that adhere to Poynter’s International Fact-Checking Network fact-checkers’ code of principles the most egregious and viral fake news articles flagged by users and algorithms. These include non-partisanship and fairness; transparency of sources, methodology and funding; and a commitment to corrections. Facebook is starting with the five above but hopes to grow that list to dozens to quickly get a consensus on a story’s accuracy. \r\n\r\nIf they confirm a story is fake, they notify Facebook through a special reporting website it exclusively built for them, and can include a link to a post debunking the article. Facebook will then show posts of those links lower in the News Feed. It will also attach a warning label noting “Disputed by [one or more of the fact checkers]” with a link to the debunking post on News Feed stories and in the status composer if users are about to share a dubious link, plus prohibit disputed stories from being turned into ads.\r\n\r\nFacebook will only send the most popular potentially fake news stories to avoid inundating the fact-checkers; if publishers disagree with their labels they’ll have to take it up with the third-parties. Mosseri confirms that these fact-checking services won’t receive any payment from Facebook, but may get a traffic and branding boost from the debunk post links.\r\n\r\nAs for why services would do the fact-checking labor for free, Mosseri says, “We’ve been met with a lot of positivity. What we’re doing, we believe, is aligned wit their mission.” As for the risk of them too aggressively labeling stories as fake, Mosseri says. “I think that it’s going to be very public what they dispute, and it’s going to put them under healthy scrutiny. So If they just start disputing to try to get traffic, people will see what they’re disputing and call them out if there’s any issues…I think there’s checks and balances actually on both sides.”\r\n\r\nBeyond warnings, Facebook is making it easier for users to report fake news with the top-right corner drop-down menu on News Feed. It will analyze whether people are significantly less likely to share an article after reading it, and use that as a signal that a post is low value and should be shown less prominently in the News Feed.\r\n\r\nSpammy Facebook Pages that try to masquerade as legitimate publishers (think TechCrunch.co instead of the real TechCrunch.com) will have their stories shown less. And Facebook will continue to detect people commenting “fake” or “hoax” on links to power down-ranking and referrals to fact checkers.\r\n\r\nFinally, Facebook is trying to hit purposeful fake news spreaders in the wallet. It will no longer allow domain spoofing in ads that previously spammers say an ad led to a legit publisher instead of their own site. Facebook will also scan landing pages of suspected fakers, and if they’re primarily just ad-covered spam sites potentially levy enforcement actions against them.\r\n\r\nAs for how Facebook will handle all this on the backend, Mosseri says “There are both algorithms and humans involved.” Specifically, “a small team” of Facebook staffers will help check on fake news sites masquerading as real publishers, but “There’s no people involved in the sense that no one [from Facebook] is going to weigh in on whether these stories are true or false.” Algorithms will tally fake news signals and prioritize what’s sent to the fact checkers.\r\n\r\nDisrupting fake news and banishing the most obvious cases from the feed is essential to keeping the world accurately informed. Indeed, 44 percent of U.S. adults have said they get news from Facebook, and its 1.8 billion users make the impact of hoaxes on the platform massive. Facebook will have to execute on these changes without appearing to lean to the left, as its leadership and employees are known to be liberal, exacerbating accusations that its Trends feature suppressed conservative stories.\r\n\r\nIf Facebook’s multi-prong approach can decrease the prevalence of fake news without becoming overbearing truth police, it could dismantle one of the greatest threats to its future as a core internet utility.', 'Internet', 0x75706c6f61642f66622d66616b652d6e657773312e706e67, '2016-12-16 20:17:54', 0, 0),

(6, 'Team TechForum', 'Don’t make poets become programmers', 'Computers are now part of everything we do. Resultantly, there is a growing assumption that everyone is going to have to master programming in addition to their other skills. Just as there was a push towards “data literacy,” we are seeing a similar push towards “code literacy.”\r\n\r\nThe industry’s current approach to hiring reflects this shift and it is becoming somewhat problematic. In particular, we are seeing more and more companies taking the stance that, no matter your core job, being able to program is always going to be a plus.\r\n\r\nThis is a really bad idea.\r\n\r\nTo understand my position, let’s go back to 2009. My research partner, Larry Birnbaum, and I started teaching a class at Medill, Northwestern University’s School of Journalism, aimed at bringing computer science and journalism students together in cross-functional teams.  \r\n\r\n2009 was also the year in which it was becoming clear that journalism was being massively disrupted along every imaginable dimension because of a combination of factors; Google (disintermediation), Craigslist (undercutting the monetization of classifieds) and the rise of Web 2.0 (everyone was a journalist). In response to this disruption, journalism students thought they needed to learn programming.  \r\n\r\nLarry and I envisioned a different path forward. Rather than learning to program, they needed to develop the ability to work with engineers. In many ways, journalism was expanding beyond writing -- stories were becoming multi-faceted products and journalists needed to become media product designers. They needed to be able to communicate functional needs to engineers who could execute against them and provide ongoing feedback during the process. This is a far more powerful skill than knowing javascript.\r\n\r\nOf course, since 2009, computation and connectivity have disrupted nearly everything. And as a result, we are hearing the same siren song drawing everyone to the nirvana of programming training. The message is simple: Computers are the future and if you don’t know how to program, you will be left behind. Period.\r\n\r\nIf we step back for a moment, it is clear that we shouldn’t blindly follow the programming path:  \r\n\r\nYes, computers are the future. There is very little in the developed world that is untouched by computation and their impact will continue to grow.\r\nYes, we need more developers at all levels and all areas of work. If the number of people with computational skills does not increase, we will fall behind.\r\nAnd yes, there are powerful problem-solving skills that are also aligned with learning how to program, and these skills are powerful tools in a wide variety of areas.\r\nWe can all agree on these points. But it does not follow that in order to function in business and the rest of world, everyone needs to be able to write (or even understand) code.  \r\n\r\nI do argue that everyone should learn how to decompose large problems into smaller ones, abstract solutions in a way that makes them reusable and think about the complexity of those solutions. These are skills that flow from training in “computational thinking” and make people into better problem solvers. But there is a huge difference between computational thinking and programming.\r\n\r\nAnd these skills are only one component of a larger suite of reasoning capabilities. Everyone should learn how to avoid cognitive pitfalls such as functional fixedness and sunk cost fallacy and be able to think about innovation as defined by needs and goals and craft communication for impact’s sake.\r\n\r\nThese are essential skills that are rarely part of a software engineer’s training. \r\n\r\nThe future workforce is going to require more than the ability to code -- we also need people who are able to craft the next round of transformational products and services. \r\n\r\nFor example, Uber’s success stems from effective use of technologies aimed at a product that is the poster child for disruption. It connected underutilized resources (drivers and cars) with users who were impatient with a locked down and highly regulated market. The Uber stack is essential, but the innovation that drives it is less the code base and more the product. When we hear people suggesting things like, “Uber for dry cleaners,” we understand that they’re suggesting a direct and flexible relationship between customer and server; they are not talking about code.\r\n\r\nAn even more timely example is Microsoft’s efforts to build out its chatbot platform. It is a reflection of the balance between engineering and product. The company’s chatbot team has developers but it also has improvisors and poets who shape the chatbots’ conversational interactions. The result is a powerful cross-functional team made up of experts able to leverage each other’s technical and linguistic strengths.\r\n\r\nWe all have finite cognitive resources. Imagine if everyone had to not only understand and reason about the problems associated with their own jobs (e.g. how are we going to get millennials to buy life insurance?) while also thinking about the data layer (e.g. how do I determine the probability of risk aversion associated with a given age?) and implementation (e.g. should I use pandas or statsmodels to do my regression analysis?). If everyone has to think about everything all the time, nothing would ever get done.\r\n\r\nYes, you probably need a boatload of new developers and you should hire them. But do not assume that all new employees should know how to program. There are skills that complement those of the developer that, depending on the role, trump the ability to write code.\r\n\r\nInstead of having everyone learn javascript, it might make more sense for us all to take communication classes. Then, at least, we’ll be able to effectively talk with each other about the products and services we want to build as well as the way we are going to go about building them.', 'Computer', 0x75706c6f61642f70726f6772616d6d6572312e6a7067, '2016-12-16 20:22:26', 0, 0),
(7, 'Team TechForum', 'Why I’m Pretty Excited By Nokia’s Incoming Android Phones', 'Nokia''s Return To The Mobile Space With Android WILL Be IMMENSE. God! I''ve Missed Nokia So Much...\r\n\r\nNokia used to be the world’s biggest phone maker. When you thought of mobile phones you thought of Nokia. The brand was synonymous with mobile technology, just as Apple iand Samsung are right now.\r\n\r\nBut things went sour quickly for Nokia after the arrival of Apple and Android. Like BlackBerry, Nokia moved too slowly and failed to spot the threat to its control of the mobile market and, between the years of 2007 to 2012, the Nokia brand effectively died.\r\n\r\nThen came Windows Phone and, well, we all know how that played out…\r\n\r\nBut Nokia will return in 2016 and this time it will be using Google’s Android platform, apparently. As a long standing fan of Nokia, its approach to design and its thirst for innovation, I am really rather excited about this.\r\n\r\nNokia’s return might be a little later than expected. Multiple reports – including intelligence from our own sources – suggested Nokia would release a phone before the close of 2016. However, it is now looking more likely that the first Nokia Android phone will arrive in early 2017 – Q1, most likely, following a launch at MWC 2017.\r\n\r\n“Nokia is launching a new phones section on its site today,” reports The Verge, “marking the return of Nokia-branded smartphones and tablets after Microsoft acquired its phone business and killed off the Nokia brand in favor of Lumia for smartphones. The first Nokia-branded smartphones powered by Android will be available in the first half of 2017, alongside Nokia-branded feature phones.”\r\n\r\nThe first two phones will be a mid-ranger and a flagship device. In terms of specs, the high-end phone will likely be pretty impressive with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon CPU at its core, a high-end imaging unit for photography and a decent sized battery. It’ll be interesting to see what route Nokia takes with the software, though. Will it go the BlackBerry/Moto route and leave the overall design of Android alone? Or, are we looking at a more OnePlus-style approach, whereby the company overlays its own bespoke UX?\r\n\r\nA Microsoft exec has now confirmed that Nokia will INDEED launch a couple of phones in 2016/17. Here''s the scoop via Phone Arena:\r\n\r\n"The CEO of mobile device commodities of Microsoft Asia, James Rutherfoord was quoted in the Vietnamese media saying that HMD Global plans to launch two new phones in Q4 2016 and at least two smartphones in early Q2 2017."\r\n\r\nWill we see these handsets at MWC 2017? Nokia will 100% be there, so it is likely the company will use the platform to launch new hardware. Finger''s crossed we see some new hardware before that though as MWC is still quite a ways off.\r\n\r\nMore information has surfaced about Nokia’s Android Phones this week. According to reports the Nokia Android Phones will pack in a metallic, unibody design, QHD displays and Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 CPUs. Odd, considering the Snapdragon 821 is now official. But, hey, things can change.\r\n\r\nNokia will apparently release two or three phones in 2016. The news comes via one of the company’s China execs, who confirmed that Nokia would indeed aim to release two handsets inside Q4 — two flagship handsets — and potentially a third, although that one could be delayed until Q1 2017.\r\n\r\nOut of the three handsets, two of them will be flagship-grade handsets, which means high-end specs and lots of features. It also likely means a big price tag to boot. The third, which is expected to be a mid-range outing, will likely go toe-to-toe with handsets like the Wileyfox and Moto G4.\r\n\r\nNokia will likely have a BIG presence at next year''s MWC 2017 expo. \r\n\r\nThere will be a 5.5in flagship handset and it will be water and dust resistant. A 22MP camera is also rumoured, though it likely won’t be branded “PureView” as that brand name is now owned by Microsoft — we think!? — but this doesn’t mean it won’t be as good. Nokia has excellent pedigree when it comes to imaging technology.\r\n\r\nI''m now pretty excited by the prospect of Nokia''s return. And below are six points on why you should be too!\r\n\r\nThe Nokia Brand Is Still Strong\r\nCheck around online. Read comments on articles about Nokia’s return. Hell, you can even read old Lumia reviews. Do this and you will see a trend — Nokia’s brand appeal, despite a good few years in exile, is still very strong inside the hearts and minds of A LOT of consumers.\r\n\r\nUnlike BlackBerry, Nokia has always been a consumer-facing brand. A lot of its phones are classics. Take the 3310, for instance. Most people, at some point in their life, have owned a Nokia phone. People trust Nokia. People remember Nokia. And I think a strong return in 2016 with Android, as well as some core USPs, will jog people’s memory about Nokia and see people out in droves to check out their new hardware.\r\n\r\nI know — this sounds like wishful thinking. But I have faith that Nokia can design its way into contention on the already packed Android space. It has great people and a better understanding than most about what makes a great phone. Throw in all the benefits you get with Android Nougat and, well, a flagship Nokia phone in 2016 starts to sound very compelling.\r\n\r\nNokia Knows How To Design The Hell Out of Things\r\nNokia has produced hundreds of phones over the years, phones of all shapes and sizes. Nokia knows how to design handsets that stand out from the crowd. Even the phones during its Lumia campaign were notable for their robust, unique styling; things only came apart on the software front, and that was all Microsoft''s doing. The Lumia 1520 and Lumia 1020 immediately spring to mind; these handsets still look cool today, despite their age. Nokia''s also one of only a small group of manufacturers who know how to build in plastic and still make a phone feel like a quality, £400+ price tag worthy product.\r\n\r\nI cannot wait to see what Nokia’s designers come to the fray with in 2016. I hope it is something original; there is a lot of room for some innovation with design in the Android space. Most phones look and feel the same these days — rectangular, slim slabs — so it’d be nice to see Nokia inject some je ne sais quoi into things in this regard.\r\n\r\nAndroid Solves All Previous Issues\r\nWindows Phone as an ecosystem couldn’t keep up with Android and iOS. It lacked applications, content and services. This is one of the many reasons why Microsoft scrapped it. The platform itself was plenty powerful and well optimised, but when most people — like 90% — are used to Apple’s App Store and Google Play, an understocked Windows Store simply don’t cut the mustard.\r\n\r\nWith Android Nougat at the core of its phones, Nokia simply doesn’t need to worry about software. It can focus on what it does best — hardware.\r\n\r\nSomething Different? \r\nHow Nokia will differentiate its Android phones remains to be seen, but one this is certain: whatever it releases they WILL need a fairly good selection of unique selling points. Android is a great platform but it doesn’t solve everything for Nokia or anybody else for that matter. Just look at HTC and Sony and LG – all formally big players squabbling over tiny portions of the market nowadays.\r\n\r\nWhether Nokia competes on price, features or design is anyone’s guess. Personally, I am hoping it is a combination of all three. I’d like to see it take the OnePlus approach to mobile: low prices, great specs, excellent software. This tactic has been proven to work time and time again for OnePlus, so it stands to reason there is some method to the company’s madness. Its handsets essentially fill the void left by Google’s Nexus phones. Nokia could compete here with gusto and it’d likely make a lot of new friends in the process.\r\n\r\n"Consumers everywhere are getting savvy about how and where they buy their smartphones, and this is opening up new doors for OEMs and causing some traditional channels to lose some control of the hardware flow," said Ryan Reith, program vice president with IDC''s Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker. "Smartphones sold into eTailer channels grew 65% in 2015 and are expected to account for roughly 12% of smartphone shipments in 2016, up from just 4% in 2013. Consumers are having more say over which brands they want and at the same time able to bargain shop."\r\n\r\nOutside of the few remaining markets with low smartphone penetration, the focus has shifted toward trying to ensure that smartphone life cycles aren''t extended further. IDC believes early trade-in programs, much like the one Apple is facilitating, as well as the broader range of cheap unlocked devices, will play a significant role in keeping mature market life cycles close to two years.\r\n\r\n"Despite single-digit growth for the overall smartphone market throughout the forecast period, Phablets (devices with 5.5-inch screens and larger) are expected to have double-digit growth until 2019, then slowing to 9.2% growth in 2020," said Anthony Scarsella, research manager with IDC''s Mobile Phones team. "Vendors continue to push larger screened devices at a variety of price points that feature big bold displays as well as powerful multimedia capabilities in both mature and developed markets. We are witnessing a plethora of vendors shifting their flagship devices towards the Phablet category as the average selling price for a Phablet will remain significantly higher than a regular smartphone ($383 vs. $260 in 2016) through the forecast period."\r\n\r\nPrice — Nokia Will Go For Competitive Angle\r\nWord on the street suggests Nokia will release a range of phones which will include a flagship device and a couple of more affordable units. What I hope doesn’t happen is that Nokia just goes after the budget space — this would suck. If Nokia is returning to the phone space it needs to do so with a BANG.\r\n\r\nAlso, things have changed quite a bit since it departed from the phone market. OnePlus has shown you can run a viable business with network support and lower cost hardware. Wouldn’t it be nice if Nokia’s return took a few plays from OnePlus’  handbook and championed cutting edge hardware at uber-competitive prices?\r\n\r\nNokia Loves To Innovate\r\nWhether you’re talking about camera technology or the overall physical design of a phone, Nokia has excellent pedigree in both. It was the first to really popularise the camera phone format and then it debuted its PureView camera technology at MWC 2012. In between this Nokia consistently pushed the boundaries with the design, build materials and integral nature of its phones.\r\n\r\nI miss Nokia’s balls-out approach to things. I’d also love to see its PureView technology re-jigged for 2016/17. Beyond this Nokia is well placed to do some innovating in a space where most simply attempt to keep up with Apple and Samsung. LG and HTC have done a lot in 2016 to add in value to their releases, but I believe Nokia’s approach to things and its talented team will go one better and give us something to really look forward to.\r\n\r\nI know this is a rather gushing post on Nokia. But I do believe the mobile space is a duller place without the firm. I always remember getting excited by the arrival of a new Nokia phone back in the day, whether the N8 or N900, it didn’t matter, as I always knew it’d be something different. \r\n\r\nI just hope Nokia hasn’t lost the magic it once had!', 'Mobile', 0x75706c6f61642f6e6f6b69612d63312e312e706e67, '2016-12-17 02:06:32', 0, 0),

Some are wondering if Verizon will ask for a discount on the $4.8 billion deal or scrap it altogether.\r\n\r\nTechCrunch is owned by Verizon, but we do not have inside information on the latest deal conversations. (We’ve reached out, but haven’t been given a comment).\r\n\r\nWhat we do know is that, regardless of the hacks, Verizon has been interested in Yahoo for strategic reasons. There’s a lot of overlap between its business and Verizon-owned AOL. Both have built robust content and adtech businesses. And they can combine forces with their legacy email and search categories.\r\n\r\nAfter the first big Yahoo hack was unveiled a few months ago, there were reports that Verizon would demand a $1 billion discount. In an October earnings call, Verizon CFO Fran Shammo said they were “still evaluating what it means for the transaction.” But we have not been given any reason to believe that the deal was no longer happening.\r\n\r\nShould the latest hack change things? Well, it’s certainly not a good look for Yahoo.\r\n\r\nIn an era where we have foreign governments meddling with our national elections, the world has been reminded of the importance of email security. If the breach leads to a significant number of users fleeing Yahoo, then this makes it a less attractive deal.\r\n\r\nVerizon execs have a fiduciary duty to investors to make sure that they are completing an acquisition that they believe is good for the company’s stock. They will likely be weighing whether the damage to Yahoo’s brand is enough to hurt its growth potential.\r\n\r\nOne could also expect that Verizon executives would want to be certain that Yahoo didn’t withhold information about the hack in the deal negotiations. If Yahoo knew more about the breach than they let on, Verizon would have an especially good reason to ask for a discount. A betrayal of trust would not be a good way to start the new relationship.\r\n\r\nA Yahoo spokesperson told us that “we are confident in Yahoo’s value and we continue to work towards integration with Verizon.”', 'Internet', 0x75706c6f61642f6d6172697373612d6d617965722e6a7067, '2016-12-17 02:10:47', 0, 0),

(10, 'Team TechForum', 'Google brings its upgraded keyboard app Gboard to Android', 'Google today officially announced that it’s rebranding its Google Keyboard application for Android users to “Gboard,” the name sported by its newer keyboard app that sports a fully integrated Google Search engine, emoji and GIF search, and more. The keyboard’s Android launch had been spotted earlier this week by a number of media sites and blogs, who had also noted app arrived with a few new features, as well.\r\n\r\nGboard was first launched on iOS around six months ago, as a means of giving Google a better way to integrate its search engine on users’ devices. Instead of putting it into a separate app, Google bundled search into the screen people use the most – their keyboard.\r\n\r\nOn Android, Gboard includes the same feature set as found in its iOS predecessor, as most of its changes were more about adding polish and addressing a few user concerns, rather than overhauling the core experience.\r\n\r\nscreen-shot-2016-12-16-at-1-18-23-pm\r\n\r\nIn the new app, you can now tap a Google logo to start your search – a tweak that makes access to Google search a bit more obvious.\r\n\r\nThe benefit of having search built in like this is that search results can be easily shared from your keyboard. This comes in handy when you want to share a business’s address, weather, flight times, news articles, restaurant info and more with your friend, without having to launch a separate app to dig up that information. Gboard will also predict possible searches, based on your chat which you may find either very useful or super creepy.\r\n\r\nFor example, the company explains, if you’re chatting with a friend about the weather, the app may offer a prediction for “Weather” which you could then share with a tap.\r\n\r\nThe app includes built in GIF and emoji search, too, like the iOS version does. A clever trick here is that Google makes it quicker to find the right emoji. Instead of scrolling, you can just do a search for the one you want (e.g. “monkey”).\r\n\r\nOne new feature that arrives with the Android app is an option to always show the number row on the screen – something that was one of users’ complaints about the keyboard layout. The app added support for multiple languages, as well, which will help bilingual users with their searches and the app’s predictions.\r\n\r\ngboard_multilingual_typing\r\n\r\nYou can also choose to turn on Glide Typing, if that’s your preferred mode of text entry. And the app offers a standard lineup of keyboard features like text predictions, autocorrect, and voice typing.\r\n\r\nGboard will work in over 100 languages as it rolls out today to all markets, and more will be added in time.\r\n\r\n', 'Internet', 0x75706c6f61642f73637265656e2d73686f742d323031362d31322d31362d61742d312d31382d32332d706d2e706e67, '2016-12-17 02:14:53', 0, 0);

The only indication that it isn''t completely dead is that the power light is still on.<br />After establishing that there was no problem with the Bluetooth connection, I let the battery run flat (I didn''t really have a choice) and charged them up again. They seemed to work fine, afterwards, but the fault quickly reappeared.

I carry it on my keychain so it''s always with me when I''m out and about. It''s not the most powerful battery pack available but, imo, it''s the most convenient. One feature I especially like is that it doesn''t require a cable to charge your phone, it has a micro USB connector built-in. With other battery packs you have to make sure you carry the charger cord as well as battery which makes it less portable.<br />With all of these battery packs, you need to remember to keep the pack charged, nothing worse then pulling out your battery backup only to find out you forgot to recharge it!</p>', 0x696d6167652f, '2016-12-16'),
